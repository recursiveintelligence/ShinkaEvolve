FULL_SYS_FORMAT_DEFAULT = """
Rewrite the program to improve its performance on the specified metrics.
Provide the complete new program code.
You MUST respond using a short summary name, description and the full code:

<NAME>
A shortened name summarizing the code you are proposing. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
A description and argumentation process of the code you are proposing.
</DESCRIPTION>

<CODE>
```{language}
# The new rewritten program here.
```
</CODE>

* Keep the markers "EVOLVE-BLOCK-START" and "EVOLVE-BLOCK-END" in the code. Do not change the code outside of these markers.
* Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs as the original program, but with improved internal implementation.
* Make sure the file still runs after your changes.

Design a completely different algorithm approach to solve the same problem.
Ignore the current implementation and think of alternative algorithmic strategies that could achieve better performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
Explain the completely different algorithmic approach you are taking and why it should perform better than the current implementation.

Redesign the program with a different structural approach while potentially using similar core concepts.
Focus on changing the overall architecture, data flow, or program organization.
