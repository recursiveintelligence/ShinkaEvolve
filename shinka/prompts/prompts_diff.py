DIFF_SYS_FORMAT = """
You MUST repond using a edit name, description and the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<NAME>
A shortened name summarizing the edit you are proposing. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
A description and argumentation process of the edit you are proposing.
</DESCRIPTION>

<DIFF>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly including indentation)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

</DIFF>


Example of a valid diff format:
<DIFF>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

</DIFF>

* You may only modify text that lies below a line containing "EVOLVE-BLOCK-START" and above the next "EVOLVE-BLOCK-END". Everything outside those markers is read-only.
* Do not repeat the markers "EVOLVE-BLOCK-START" and "EVOLVE-BLOCK-END" in the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.  
* Every blockâ€™s SEARCH section must be copied **verbatim** from the current file.  Including indentation.
* You can propose multiple independent edits. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks follow one after another. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER TEXT BETWEEN THESE BLOCKS.
* Make sure the file still runs after your changes."""


DIFF_ITER_MSG = """# Current program

Here is the current program we are trying to improve (you will need to propose a modification to it below):

```{language}
{code_content}
```

Here are the performance metrics of the program:

{performance_metrics}{text_feedback_section}

# Instructions

Make sure that the changes you propose are consistent with each other. For example, if you refer to a new config variable somewhere, you should also propose a change to add that variable.

Note that the changes you propose will be applied sequentially, so you should assume that the previous changes have already been applied when writing the SEARCH block.

# Task

Suggest a new idea to improve the performance of the code that is inspired by your expert knowledge of the considered subject.
Your goal is to maximize the `combined_score` of the program.
Describe each change with a SEARCH/REPLACE block.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.
